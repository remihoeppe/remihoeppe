## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks for having a snoop on my GitHub profile.
Here you'll find projects I've worked on either purely for fun or to explore some new language or library.

About me:

After finisihing my Biotechnologies studies in France, I pocketed my degree and went on a very different path.
I decided to start a career in Hospitality, managing bars and restaurants in Paris, London before eventually making my way to Sydney.
While this industry has given me so much, I eventually decided to re-route myself once more.
